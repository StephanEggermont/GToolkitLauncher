# Launcher and version manager for Glamorous Toolkit

GToolkitLauncher lets you keep several versions of Glamorous Toolkit around, and run each of them with ease. A bit like `pyenv` for python, or [rustup](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/) for Rust.  

## Installation
Install Glamorous Toolkit. On the 'start page', in _Local Knowledge Base_ choose 'Add new page'. Call it something like `Environment Setup`. Add a `Pharo` block, and copy this in:

```st
Metacello new
	repository: 'github://StephanEggermont/GToolkitLauncher:main/src';
	baseline: 'GToolkitLauncher';
	load
```

Then add another `Pharo` block. Copy the line below, to load the rest of the installation instructions inside the Glamorous toolkit environment:

```st
BaselineOfGToolkitLauncher loadLepiter
```

At the bottom of your `Environment Setup` page, you will now see `Documents/lepiter/default`. Lepiter is the name of the documentation software. Click on there, to select

After clicking on this, the documentation will show up in the 'Pages' view on the left, as part of the history of contents.
